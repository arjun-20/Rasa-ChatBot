# Basic Mathematical Operations Chatbot
This is a simple chatbot that can perform basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.<br> 
The chatbot is built using RASA, an open-source framework for building conversational AI assistants.


# Usage
Train the dialogue model: rasa train<br>
Start the chatbot server: rasa run actions & rasa shell<br>
The above commands will train dialogue models, and start the chatbot server. You can then interact with the chatbot using the RASA shell.
